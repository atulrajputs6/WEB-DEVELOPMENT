CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language used to control the presentation of web pages. It allows you to style HTML or XML documents with ease, making your web pages look attractive and professional.

### Key Features of CSS:

1. **Selectors**: These are used to target the HTML elements you want to style.
2. **Properties and Values**: These define the specific styles you want to apply to the selected elements.
3. **Box Model**: This concept describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements, including margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
4. **Flexbox**: A layout model that helps you align and distribute space among items in a container.
5. **Grid**: A powerful system for creating complex and responsive web layouts.
6. **Media Queries**: These allow your content to adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.
7. **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: These are used to style elements based on their state or position in the document.

### Basic CSS Syntax:

/* This is a comment in CSS */

/* Select an HTML element (e.g., <p>) and apply styles to it */
p {
    color: blue; /* Sets the text color to blue */
    font-size: 16px; /* Sets the font size to 16 pixels */
    margin: 10px; /* Adds a 10-pixel margin around the element */
}

/* Select an element with a specific class (e.g., <div class="container">) */
.container {
    width: 100%; /* Sets the width of the element to 100% of its parent */
    padding: 20px; /* Adds 20 pixels of padding inside the element */
    background-color: lightgray; /* Sets the background color to light gray */
}

/* Select an element with a specific ID (e.g., <h1 id="title">) */
#title {
    text-align: center; /* Centers the text inside the element */
    font-weight: bold; /* Makes the text bold */
    color: darkred; /* Sets the text color to dark red */
}
